### Hi there 👋

I am a software engineer from Singapore. I am also an undergraduate studying Computer Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

I believe in making technology accessible to others and creating software that improves the lives of others. I primary work along two fronts - technical writing and software engineering. As a writer, my goal is to make learning about new technologies and concepts easy for readers. As a software engineer, I am to build software that benefits others.

### Experiences 💼

I have performed natural language processing research @ DSO National Laboratories, coordinated UAT testing across 90+ teams @ DBS Bank, and pioneered a user-accessibility framework for Android @ MightyAim!

Presently, I am a part of the Google Developer Student Club @ NUS, building software for social good! I also write for BetterStack Community as a guest author, developing approachable learning material for various topics!

### Writings 📝

I am an avid writer and love teaching through my writings. I have even written for companies as a guest author.
