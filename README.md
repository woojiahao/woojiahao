### Hi there 👋 I am Jiahao!

I am a software engineer, Elixir enthusiast, technical author, and all around tech nerd! I love building projects, writing about building projects, and talking about building projects. I open-source most of my projects on GitHub and my knowledge through my blog.

I have had the opportunity to dip my toes into many different fields and roles throughout the years:

- [NOW] Fullstack Engineer Intern @ Palantir
- Site Reliability Engineer Intern @ Citadel
- Fullstack Engineer Intern @ Betafi
- Backend Engineer @ NUS Google Developer Student Club 
- NLP Research Intern @ DSO National Laboratories
- Android Developer @ MightyAim

I also like to cook 🍳, boulder 🧗‍♂️, run at night 🌃, and speedrun Hades 🕹️.
