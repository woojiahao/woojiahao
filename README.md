### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Jiahao!

I am a computer science student, software engineer, Elixir enthusiast, technical author, and all-around tech nerd! I open-source my projects on <a href="https://github.com/woojiahao">GitHub</a> and my knowledge on my <a href="https://blog.woojiahao.com">blog</a>. 

Right now, I'm working to develop @git-mastery, a Git education tool to help students pick up Git through fun and interactive puzzles with consistent feedback!
