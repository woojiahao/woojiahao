### Hi there 👋

I am Jia Hao, a software developer from tiny red dot — Singapore! I use various technologies but my primary focus is in backend systems — managing databases and building APIs. Lately, I have been working on [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/) with [Elixir](https://github.com/woojiahao/advent-of-code-2021) and building [Apollo](https://github.com/woojiahao/advent-of-code-2021) — an RSS aggregator made with Electron, React and Tailwind!

I have performed natural language processing reseasrch @ DSO National Laboratories, coordinated UAT testing across 90+ teams @ DBS Bank, and pioneered a user-accessibility framework for Android @ MightyAim!

I had also recently started a new blog series — Open-source Deep Dive — where I explore open-source projects to uncover and explain the underlying concepts that make them tick. My first post about Hound was featured on Elixir Digest! My second post about Broadway is out too!
