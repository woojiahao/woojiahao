### Hi there 👋

I am Jia Hao, a software developer from tiny red dot — Singapore! I am studying Computer Science at the National University of Singapore! I use various technologies but my primary focus is in backend systems — managing databases and building APIs. 

My most recent projects include [chris](https://github.com/woojiahao/chris), a Pratt parser implementation for mathematical equations built with Golang and [life](https://github.com/woojiahao/life), a Conway's Game of Life visualizer built with Elixir! 

### Experiences 💼

I have performed natural language processing reseasrch @ DSO National Laboratories, coordinated UAT testing across 90+ teams @ DBS Bank, and pioneered a user-accessibility framework for Android @ MightyAim!

Presently, I am a part of the Google Developer Student Club @ NUS, building software for social good! I also write for BetterStack Community as a guest author, developing approachable learning material for various topics!

### Writings 📝

I am an avid writer and love teaching through my writings. I have even written for companies as a guest author.
