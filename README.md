### Hi there 👋 I am Jiahao!

 I am a software engineer, Elixir enthusiast, technical author, and all around tech nerd! I love building projects, writing about building projects, and talking about building projects. I open-source most of my projects on GitHub and my knowledge through my blog.

I am currently a Site Reliability Engineer Intern at Citadel and working on improving my comprehensive Technical Interview Study Guide for internship hunting.

I also like to cook 🍳, boulder 🧗‍♂️, run at night 🌃, and speedrun Hades 🕹️.
