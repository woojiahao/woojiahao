### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Jia Hao, a software developer from tiny red dot - Singapore! I use various technologies but my primary focus is in backend systems - managing databases and building APIs. Lately, I have been improving [my personal site](https://woojiahao.github.io) and working with Elixir!

I have performed natural language processing reseasrch @ DSO National Laboratories, coordinated UAT testing across 90+ teams @ DBS Bank, and pioneered a user-accessibility framework for Android @ MightyAim!

I am currently serving in the Singapore army. ðŸª–

I had also recently started a new blog series - Open-source Deep Dive - where I explore open-source projects to uncover and explain the underlying concepts that make them tick. My first post about Hound was featured on Elixir Digest!
