### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Woo Jia Hao, a software developer from tiny red dot - Singapore! I use various technologies but my primary focus is in backend systems - managing databases and building APIs. Lately, however, I have been working with front-end technologies like [Vue](https://github.com/woojiahao/productivity) and [Gatsby.js](https://github.com/woojiahao/woojiahao.github.io).

I am currently waiting to enlist into the Singapore army!
